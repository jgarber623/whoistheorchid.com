Available exclusively on [Bandcamp](https://theorchid.bandcamp.com/album/shadowing-lull-ep), the <cite>Shadowing Lull EP</cite> features two new interpretations of the classic song paired with remixes by [Jonah Matranga](http://jonahmatranga.com) and [John Whitlock](http://www.johnwhitlock.tv/).

The newly-recorded version of <cite>Shadowing Lull</cite> better reflects the song's transformation over the years since its original release on 2010's <cite>[New Mexico EP](/releases/new-mexico-ep)</cite> and hints at the band's evolving sound.

Multi-instrumentalist James Wolf's reinterpretation of the song is a mind-bending aural experience unlike anything released by the band to date. John Whitlock's and Jonah Matranga's contributions similarly reshape <cite>Shadowing Lull</cite> in new and unique ways. Long-time collaborator Tim Gerak at [Mammoth Cave Recording Studio](http://mammothcavestudio.com) returns to mix and master the EP.

Available now in a variety of digital formats exclusively on Bandcamp. [Get your copy today](https://theorchid.bandcamp.com/album/shadowing-lull-ep).
