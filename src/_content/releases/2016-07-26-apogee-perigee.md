The Orchid's sophomore LP is now available exclusively on [Bandcamp](https://theorchid.bandcamp.com/album/apogee-perigee). Six songs exploring the theme of isolation for at least $8<sup><span>.</span>00</sup>.

<cite>Apogee, Perigee</cite> sees the band pushing its increasingly complex arrangements and instrumentation to the extremes: its wall of sound assault has become more aggressive and anthemic and its quieter passages more delicate and nuanced. Again a five-piece, The Orchid partnered with producer and engineer Kenny Eaton, recording at his [Mystery Ton Studios](https://www.facebook.com/MysteryTonStudios) in rural Maryland.

From the massive, three-guitar assault of album opener, <cite>The Astronaut (Escape Velocity)</cite>, to the haunting, suffocating sparseness of the closing <cite>Life in Retrograde</cite>, the album weaves together influences ranging from Morricone's Spaghetti Western soundscapes to DC-infused punk and math rock. The album moves effortlessly from crushing rhythms to delicate, intertwined arpeggiated guitars—often within a single song.

Available now in a variety of digital formats exclusively on Bandcamp. [Get your copy today](https://theorchid.bandcamp.com/album/apogee-perigee).
